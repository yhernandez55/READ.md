## About Me
Hey there, I am passionate about how data can leverage the power to make data-driven decisions and solutions. With a Bachelor's 
in Applied Mathematical Sciences, my academic journey has shown me that math can correlate with real-world applications. My 
fascination with data analytics grew during my undergraduate studies, where I delved into courses that dealt with statistical 
methods, probability, numerical methods, and computational techniques. One of the highlights of my academic experience has been 
using mathematics to model real-world problems across different domains such as thermodynamics and finance. Throughout my undergraduate 
degree, I also completed Coursera's Google Data Analytics course, which further fueled my passion for analytics. In that course, I learned
how to manipulate large datasets, identify patterns, and extract meaningful insights.

I am continuing to learn:
- Python
- MATLAB
- Rstudio
- EXCEL
