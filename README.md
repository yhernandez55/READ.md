## About Me
Hey there! Iâ€™m passionate about leveraging data to drive informed decisions and develop innovative solutions. With a Bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematical Sciences, my academic journey has shown me the strong connection between mathematics and real-world applications. My fascination with data analytics grew during my undergraduate studies, where I explored courses in statistical methods, probability, numerical methods, and computational techniques.

One of the highlights of my academic experience was using mathematics to model real-world problems across various domains. Additionally, I completed Coursera's Google Data Analytics course, which further fueled my passion for analytics. Through that course, I honed my skills in manipulating large datasets, identifying patterns, and extracting meaningful insights.

Currently, I am expanding my expertise by completing a Data Science Professional Certificate at LearningFuze, which I will finish in October 2024. This program has deepened my passion not just for data analytics, but also for data science as a whole. I am eager to apply this knowledge to solve complex problems and contribute to impactful projects.

I am continuing to learn:
- Python
- Tableau
- SQL
